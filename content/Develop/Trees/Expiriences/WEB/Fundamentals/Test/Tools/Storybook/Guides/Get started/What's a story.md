# What's a story
A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. Developers write multiple stories per component that describe all the ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù states a component can support.

The CLI created example components that demonstrate the types of components you can build with Storybook: Button, Header, and Page.

Each example component has a set of stories that show the states it supports. You can browse the stories in the UI and see the code behind them in files that end with `.stories.js` or `.stories.ts`. The stories are written in Component Story Format (CSF)--an ES6 modules-based standard--for writing component examples.

Let‚Äôs start with the `Button` component. A story is a function that describes how to render the component in question. Here‚Äôs how to render `Button` in the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù state and export a story called `Primary`.

```javascript
// Button.stories.js|jsx

import React from 'react';

import { Button } from './Button';

export default {
  /* üëá The title prop is optional.
  * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-loading
  * to learn how to generate automatic titles
  */
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button primary>Button</Button>;
```

```typescript
// Button.stories.ts|tsx 
import React from 'react'; 
import { ComponentStory, ComponentMeta } from '@storybook/react'; 
import { Button } from './Button'; 

	export default { /* üëá The title prop is optional. * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-loading * to learn how to generate automatic titles */ 
	title: 'Button', 
	component: Button, 
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>;

export const Primary: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = () => <Button primary>Button</Button>;
```

```MDX
<!-- Button.stories.mdx -->

import { Meta, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs'; 

import { Button } from './Button'; 

<Meta title="Button" component={Button} /> 

# Button 
<Story name="Primary"> 
	<Button primary>Button</Button> 
</Story>
```

![Initial button story](https://storybook.js.org/d1406df7f9ce817ae0e5b3eb5f1bf1f3/example-button-noargs.png)

View the rendered `Button` by clicking on it in the Storybook sidebar.

The above story definition can be further improved to take advantage of [Storybook‚Äôs ‚Äúargs‚Äù](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/args) concept. Args describes the arguments to Button in a machine-readable way. It unlocks Storybook‚Äôs superpower of altering and composing arguments dynamically.

```javascript
// Button.stories.js|jsx

import React from 'react';

import { Button } from './Button';

export default {
  /* üëá The title prop is optional.
  * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-loading
  * to learn how to generate automatic titles
  */
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
};

//üëá We create a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù of how args map to rendering
const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

//üëá Each story then reuses that template
export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {
   primary: true,
   label: 'Button',
};
```

```typescript
// Button.stories.ts|tsx import React from 'react';
import { ComponentStory, ComponentMeta } from '@storybook/react'; 

import { Button, ButtonProps } from './Button';

export default {
	/* üëá The title prop is optional. 
	* See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-loading 
	* to learn how to generate automatic titles */
	title: 'Button', 
	component: Button, 
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>; 
	
//üëá We create a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù of how args map to rendering const Template: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({}); 

Primary.args = {
	primary: true, 
	label: 'Button', 
};
```

![Button story with args](https://storybook.js.org/ff519d6518900d4be0ce86bbf3655913/example-button-args.png)

Both story examples render the same thing because Storybook feeds the given `args` property into the story during render. But you get timesaving conveniences with args:

-   `Button`s callbacks are logged into the Actions tab. Click to try it.
-   `Button`s arguments are dynamically editable in the Controls tab. Adjust the controls

### Edit a story

Storybook makes it easy to work on one component in one state (aka a story) at a time. When you edit the Button code or stories, Storybook will instantly re-render in the browser. No need to refresh manually.

Update the `label` of the `Primary` story, then see your change in Storybook.

Stories are also helpful for checking that UI continues to look correct as you make changes. The `Button` component has four stories that show it in different use cases. View those stories now to confirm that your change to `Primary` didn‚Äôt introduce unintentional bugs in the other stories.

Checking component‚Äôs stories as you develop helps prevent accidental regressions. [Tools that integrate with Storybook can automate this](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/introduction) for you.

Now that we‚Äôve seen the basic anatomy of a story let‚Äôs see how we use Storybook‚Äôs UI to develop stories.
