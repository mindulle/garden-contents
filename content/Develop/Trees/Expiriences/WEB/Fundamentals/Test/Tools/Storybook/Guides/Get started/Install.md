# Install Storybook

Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your _existing project‚Äôs_ root directory:

```
# Add Storybook:
npx storybook init
```

If you run into issues with the installation, check the [Troubleshooting section](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction#troubleshooting) below for guidance on how to solve it.

<details open=""><summary><code>storybook init</code> is not made for empty projects</summary><p>Storybook needs to be installed into a project that is already set up with a framework. It will not work on an empty project. There are many ways to bootstrap an app in a given framework, including:</p><ul><li>üì¶ <a href="https://angular.io/cli/new">Create an Angular Workspace</a></li><li>üì¶ <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Create React App</a></li><li>üì¶ <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html">Create a Vue App</a></li><li>üì¶ <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/">Ember CLI</a></li><li>Or any other tooling available.</li></ul></details>

Storybook will look into your project's dependencies during its install process and provide you with the best configuration available.

The command above will make the following changes to your local environment:

-   üì¶ Install the required dependencies.
-   üõ† Setup the necessary scripts to run and build Storybook.
-   üõ† Add the default Storybook configuration.
-   üìù Add some boilerplate stories to get you started.
-   üì° Set up telemetry to help us improve Storybook. Read more about it [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/telemetry).

Depending on your framework, first, build your app and then check that everything worked by running:

```shell
npm run storybook
yarn storybook
```

It will start Storybook locally and output the address. Depending on your system configuration, it will automatically open the address in a new browser tab, and you'll be greeted by a welcome screen.

-   A collection of useful links for more in-depth configuration and customization options you have at your disposal.
-   A second set of links for you to expand your Storybook knowledge and get involved with the ever-growing Storybook community.
-   A few example stories to get you started.
