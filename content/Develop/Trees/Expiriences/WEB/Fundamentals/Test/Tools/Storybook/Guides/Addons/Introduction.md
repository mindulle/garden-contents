# Introduction to addons
Addons extend Storybook with features and integrations that are not built into the core. Most Storybook features are implemented as addons. For instance: [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction), [accessibility testing](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/a11y), [interactive controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls), among others. The [addon API](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addons-api) makes it easy for you to configure and customize Storybook in new ways. There are countless addons made by the community that unlock time-saving workflows.

Browse our [addon catalog](https://storybook.js.org/addons) to install an existing addon or as inspiration for your own addon.

## Storybook basics

Before writing your first [addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons), let‚Äôs take a look at the basics of Storybook‚Äôs architecture. While Storybook presents a unified user interface, under the hood it‚Äôs divided down the middle into **Manager** and **Preview**.

The **Manager** is the UI responsible for rendering the:

-   üîç Search
-   üß≠ Navigation
-   üîó Toolbars
-   üì¶ Addons

The **Preview** area is an `iframe` where your stories are rendered.

![Storybook detailed window](https://storybook.js.org/f1d5213d42bc4321123f8a3d5f4b5076/manager-preview.jpg)

Because both elements run in their own separate `iframes`, they use a communication channel to keep in sync. For example when you select a story in the Manager an event is dispatched across the channel notifying the Preview to render the story.

## Anatomy of an addon

Storybook addons allow you to extend what's already possible with Storybook, everything from the [user interface](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addon-types) to the [API](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addons-api). Each one classified into two broader categories.

### UI-based addons

[UI-based addons](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addon-types#ui-based-addons) focus on customizing Storybook's user interface to extend your development workflow. Examples of UI-based addons include: [Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls), [Docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction) and [Accessibility](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/a11y).

### Preset addons

[Preset addons](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/addons/addon-types#preset-addons) help you integrate Storybook with other technologies and libraries. Examples of preset addons are: [preset-scss](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-scss) and [preset-create-react-app](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-create-react-app).
